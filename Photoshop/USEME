How to use the GUI:
-------------------
- Click the load button and navigate to the image that you want loaded.
- If the image type is supported and the image exists, then you will see a message that the image
  has been loaded successfully.
- Once the image is loaded, you will also see histograms of the red, green, blue, and intensity
  components.
- You can perform operations on the image by selecting an option from the drop down menu underneath
  the label "Operation to execute on the image" and then clicking the apply button.
- When you perform any operation from that drop down menu, the image being displayed will update,
  the histograms will update, and you will see a message that says that the operation you selected
  has been applied to the image successfully.
- When doing darken or brighten, we made it so that selecting either once and then clicking apply
  it either darkens or lightens the image by 5 units (the values range from 0 to 255).
- When you want to save, first click the save path button and navigate to where you want to save the
  image.
- When you choose the location, the GUI will display a message that says "The save is" and then the
  path you selected.
- Then, in the text box called save name, enter what name you want to save the image as.
- Then, from the drop down menu called save type, select the type that you want to save the image
  as.
- And finally, click the save button and you should get a message on the GUI that says that the
  image was successfully saved at the file path you previously chose.

script commands explanations:
------------------------------
To use a script file, first enter "script" and then the path of the file that you are accessing
For all of the commands, the oldName is the current name of the file that you are changing and
newName is the name that you want to refer to the changed image as.
For all of the commands, the order of entries must be the same as specified above.

To use the given script file, save that file in the assignment folder and first run the main method
and then type
"script CommandLines.txt" and then hit enter.
The program will display messages for all the commands being performed on the image and then in the
res folder in the assignment folder, there should be 40 new images saved with different combinations
of commands done.

When not using the script file, the image must be loaded before calling any of the other commands.

To quit the program, nothing besides "q" or "Q" needs to be entered.
